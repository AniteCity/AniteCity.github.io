      <h3>Anite Cangi</h3>
      <p> Hello there my name is Anite Cangi. I'm a student at City university of London. In the past I have came
		across many programming languages such as C,C++,PHP, HTML, CSS and bit of C# where we developed a small game
		in unity. With this bootcamp I was able to learn the basics of JAVA which I never had contact with and I was able
		to understand it quite easitly as it had similar sintax as the languagues I learnd. Looking forward to develop
		and learn more at City.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Hit the Ball</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of Classes, Functions, and randomness. I created a game where the user
	has to aim with the mouse a target which is constantly moving. The further the distance between the mouse
	and the main caracter(Green ball), the more "force" or speed you can put in to it. Both balls will always
	spawn in a ramdom location when starting the game and when they collide with each other. Once the green ball
	collides with the target(yellow ball) then the speed of the ball will increase making it harder to hit. In case
	you miss the yellow ball then the green ball will constantly bounce from the walls until they both collide.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<ul>
	Things I could improve in the future:
	
		<li>I could possibly end the game if the played missed the target which would make it more challenging.</li>
		<li>I could start with a large target and decrease its size and speed as the player passes through the levels.</li>
		<li>I could start the color of the target bright and make it darker and darker as the playes hits successfully the target.</li>
	</ul>

    <h3>Java 2d Game Project 2022: My first Game</h3>
    <p>
	My first game was built using Java. The game is a 2d platform style game where there are obstacles, enemies and collectables which the player has to interact with in
	order to go on the next level. My game was based on a mixture of ice and electricity caracter therefore it slides on the ground and picks up thunder.
	The objective of the game is to collect the maximum number of Thunders(points) and collect a Key which will allow to go to the next level.
	However, the path won't be that easy, there will be various type of enemies and complexity that the player will have to go through in order to pass the level.
	The game also has some features such as pausing, saving, loading and mutting the game. If you are stuck at a level you can also skip the level.
	Each level has it's unique soundtrack with amazing sound effects which will enhance the user experience. The most challenging part to create my game was
	the mute the sound depending how you closed the window. For example, the player could close the pause menu either by pressing the "resume" button, the "X" on the window
	or pressing the P key again, so for all those option I had to check if the tick box for the sound was ticked or not. Another big challenge was to create fireballs
	,make them move in a certain direction and check if it collided with an enemy or any other body.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<ul>
	Things I could improve in the future:
	
		<li>I could have a more personalised pause menu</li>
		<li>I could add more types of Heros.</li>
		<li>I could a shopping menu which the user could purchase using the thunders(points) collected</li>
	</ul>
