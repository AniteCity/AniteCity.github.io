      <h3>Anite Cangi</h3>
      <p> Hello there my name is Anite Cangi. I'm a student at City university of London. In the past I have came
		across many programming languages such as C,C++,PHP, HTML, CSS and bit of C# where we developed a small game
		in unity. With this bootcamp I was able to learn the basics of JAVA which I never had contact with and I was able
		to understand it quite easitly as it had similar sintax as the languagues I learnd. Looking forward to develop
		and learn more at City.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Hit the Ball</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of Classes, Functions, and randomness. I created a game where the user
	has to aim with the mouse a target which is constantly moving. The further the distance between the mouse
	and the main caracter(Green ball), the more "force" or speed you can put in to it. Both balls will always
	spawn in a ramdom location when starting the game and when they collide with each other. Once the green ball
	collides with the target(yellow ball) then the speed of the ball will increase making it harder to hit. In case
	you miss the yellow ball then the green ball will constantly bounce from the walls until they both collide.
	</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
		Things I could improve in the future:
	
		<li>- I could possibly end the game if the played missed the target which would make it more challenging.</li>
		<li>- I could start with a large target and decrease its size and speed as the player passes through the levels.</li>
		<li>- I could start the color of the target bright and make it darker and darker as the playes hits successfully the target.</li>
	</ul>
